Hello there, dear readers!

My name is Max and I'm a digital marketing specialist with over 8 years of experience. I'm also a junior Python developer. I'm a huge fan of cutting-edge technology and I'm always looking for ways to stay up to date with the latest trends.

I graduated from Kharkiv National Law School and started my marketing career by studying at the Computer Academy Shag in Odessa. I have a wealth of experience in digital marketing and media buying across various industries. I've poured traffic into almost all areas, except for pharma, adalt, and some other ones that I can't recall right now.

My goal is to continue growing my expertise in digital marketing and Python development. I'm constantly learning and expanding my knowledge by attending conferences, courses, and staying on top of the latest blockchain, crypto, and other advanced technologies.

On my blog, I write about high-tech, blockchain, crypto, programming, and much more. I also share my Python projects and provide tips for developers. In my free time, I love extreme sports, reading psychology, and driving fast.

I hope you'll find useful information on my page and blog, and if you have any questions, please don't hesitate to reach out to me.

Best regards,
Max
